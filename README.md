# Buoy vagabloom

This is a school's project. We made a buoy, which collect data in the ocean, like temperature, salinity, etc... These data are collected, and then sent to the satellite.
It will help us to understand the ocean, phytoplankton, and other interesting stuff.

Our scientific team is working on biodiversity, and in the technical part, we are creating this buoy.

Currently, we have to finish the software.
